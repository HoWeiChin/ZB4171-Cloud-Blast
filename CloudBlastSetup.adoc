== Preface

A powerlifting competition/meet consists of 3 lifts, the Squat, Bench and Deadlift. With 3 attempts, athletes will try to outdo and challenge themselves and lift as heavy as they can.

This software is for organisers who organise powerlifting competitions. To facilitate the ease of data-entry, we have provided a command line interface that is augmented with a Graphical User Interface to help them better administer powerlifting competitions.

Go the following URL: `https://github.com/ncbi/blast_plus_docs#google-cloud-platform-setup` .

`Step 1`: Under the table of contents, select “Google Cloud Platform Setup” as shown:

== Introduction

This documentation acts as a user guide to set up and install Blast on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

This documentation assumes the user has set up their GCP account. Otherwise, the user should look at section Preface to set up his or her GCP account.
