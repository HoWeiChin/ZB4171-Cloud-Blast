== Preface

A powerlifting competition/meet consists of 3 lifts, the Squat, Bench and Deadlift. With 3 attempts, athletes will try to outdo and challenge themselves and lift as heavy as they can.

This software is for organisers who organise powerlifting competitions. To facilitate the ease of data-entry, we have provided a command line interface that is augmented with a Graphical User Interface to help them better administer powerlifting competitions.
